# üöÄ Phoenix Dashboard - A Full-Stack Productivity App

## ‚ú® Overview

This is the "Apex" version of my Kanban board, rebuilt from the ground up as a multi-faceted productivity dashboard using **React.js**. It is a sophisticated, single-page application (SPA) that demonstrates a mastery of modern frontend architecture, state management, and data visualization.

This is a professional-grade portfolio piece designed to showcase not just coding ability, but also product design, advanced UI/UX implementation, and the ability to build complex, feature-rich applications that are both beautiful and persistent.
